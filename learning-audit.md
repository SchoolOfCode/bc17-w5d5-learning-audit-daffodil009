# Backend

    - client and server in context of Node
    - make GET request to a server
    
    - Node installing and running JS in Node
        - commong JS Modules
        - ES modules
        - File system "fs" - reading and writing files

    
    - NPM packages - how to initialise a# NPM project using npm init & install npm packages
        - express
        - nodemon
    
    - Express to
        -build servers and APIs, 
        - handle routes, 
        - request and responses,
        - parsing request bodies, 
        - session management, 
        - user authentication, 
        - error handling
    - Week4 day1 - Escape room Project to be done - GET, POST using Postman
    - default exports
    - named exports
    - import functions, modules
    
    - What is REST API (Representational State Transfer)
        - Principles of REST
        - HTTP methods : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
        - CRUD operations : CREATE, READ,UPDATE,DELETE
        - JSON files (javascript object notation)
        - Status codes an  methods (200,201, 400, 404,500)

        - middleware (request, response,next)
        -error handling (try, catch)

        - POSTMAN (API testing)
        
        - Authentication and authorization
          -custom function (write this) being used as middleware in front of the event handler 
          that checks the request for a header called ‚ÄúAuthorisation‚Äù, 
          with the value of ‚ÄúBearer TEST_TOKEN‚Äù. 
          The middleware calls next with an error if needed

          
    - Complete the REST API that allow a client to track exercise activities 
    allowing user to  GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE an existing activity
    - Express validator to check the expected request inputs
    
    - invalid DELETE request by not sending the ‚ÄúAuthorisation‚Äù header,
     When I inspect the API response, 
     Then the the API call should fail with the correct response code 
     and a clear error message (response.error).
     
    - Working with files
    - use the fs node module to read and write JSON files
    -how to read a JSON file using the promises version 
    - how to write to a JSON file using the promises version of fs module
